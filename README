Chemistry will be able to perform operations with chemical formulas, and calculate yields using stoichiometry. 

INSTALL: As of now, there is no formal 'install' feature. If you wish to run the software, you will need to compile the sources. Please note that the program is unfinished and may have bugs that could potentially cause issues with your computer. 

COMPILING: 

	make

	Important: In Chemistry.h, be sure to define CLEARSCREEN as "cls" when 	compiling on Windows systems.

USE: As of now, percent yield and limiting reactant are not available. On Mac OS X, double-click the program in Finder. On Linux, run "./Chemistry". On Windows, double-click the program in Windows Explorer.

ISSUES:  
	1. May not work properly on Windows.
	2. Incomplete.
