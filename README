Chemistry will be able to perform operations with chemical formulas, and calculate yields using stoichiometry. 

INSTALL: As of now, there is no formal 'install' feature. If you wish to run the software, you will need to compile the sources. Please note that the program is unfinished and may have bugs that could potentially cause issues with your computer. 

COMPILING: 

	make

	Important: In Chemistry.h, be sure to define CLEARSCREEN as "cls" when 	compiling on Windows systems.

USE: As of now, there is one feature that works properly: Finding atomic mass. The rest will be available shortly. On mac and linux, run the software with "./Chemistry" in terminal, providing you set the executable output name to be "Chemistry".

ISSUES:  
	1. May not work properly on Windows.
	2. Incomplete.
